# README

This code analyze SEM image and count the average diameter, the standard deviation of diameter, and the number of sphere particles.

This code allows users to manually select the scale bar area with the mouse, calibrating measurements to real-world dimensions based on the selected length. While it performs well with larger particles and lower particle counts, it has limitations when applied to images with smaller particles and higher particle density. Updates are planned to address this issue and improve accuracy in such cases.
